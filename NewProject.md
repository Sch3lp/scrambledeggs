# Kotlin Tutorial Thing

## Expectations
1) How to install IDEA
1) Basic syntax
1) Show strength of nullable types
1) Show nice iterable functions (like .map, etc.)
1) Show extension functions
1) Up to websites, databases, UI's, ...


## Why not follow a course?
More easily accessible?

You cannot ask for a specific thing you don't understand.

Good courses cost money.

Can't always skip through stuff you already know about.
So make short and sweet tutorial vids.

Not many non android Kotlin tutorials.
